# covax
Covax gathers information to teach people where they can get vaccinated if they are eligible. It will crowdsource ongoing experiences of vaccinations, vaccination appointments, and resources to set appointments while sharing information on groups that have been allotted vaccinations at particular locations. 

Users will share experiences so that others may learn where appointments can be made, if vaccines are available, if they are no longer available, and to whom they are made available. 

Users will use the application to report on their experiences with a given resource to determine if appointments can be made in real time.

Our efforts will help our community find vaccination resources in a time of uncertainty while expediting vaccination efforts for the institutions that distribute them.
